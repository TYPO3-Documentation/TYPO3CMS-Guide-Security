Report a security issue
"""""""""""""""""""""""

If you find a security issue in the TYPO3 core system or in a TYPO3
extension (even if it is your own development), please report it to
the TYPO3 Security Team â€“ the Security Team only. Do not disclose the
issue in public (for example in mailing lists, forums, on Twitter,
your website or any 3rd party website).

The team tries to answer all requests as soon as possible and strives
to respond in 2 working days, but please allow a reasonable amount of
time to assess the issue and get back to you with an answer. If you
suspect that your report has been overlooked, feel free to submit a
reminder a few days after your initial submission.

You can contact the TYPO3 Security Team at `security@typo3.org
